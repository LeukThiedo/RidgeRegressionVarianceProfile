# High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile

This repository contains the code to reproduce the numerical experiments of the paper : High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile. The functions needed to reproduce the experiments are contained in **utils.py**. The folder **plots** gathers the figures that are in the paper. The file **berlin.png** is a [free image of right](https://pixabay.com/fr/photos/berlin-tour-de-t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision-silhouette-8054311/) used to create the "berlin photo variance profile" in the numerical experiments. The other files are notebooks reproducing the experiments presented in the paper. These notebooks illustrate the double descent phenomenon and the accuracy of the predictive risk's deterministic equivalent propose on our work.
